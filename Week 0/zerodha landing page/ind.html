<body><!--There is never a comma in box-shadow property only spaces use the syntax as I have mentioned below and check in inspect box as how 
    they behave and then copy it here and always remember the styles follow margin and not padding and the styles are always applied on whole element
    and if we want to change it then we have to change size of element-->
<div style="padding-left: 60 ; padding-right: 60;display: flex;justify-content: space-between; box-shadow: 0px 0.3px 0px 0px;">
    <div style="display:flex;justify-content: flex-start;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;"><!--always add pixels in margin and padding only not in width and height as it already assumes in px and if margin is not specified
    by direction then it will add spaces in all directions for margins and padding and bg colour also changes acc to padding as
    it follows padding. -->
    <!--padding can also be applied after flexbox-->
    <img src="logo.svg"  width="170" ></img><!-- why should we put signup,About,pricing,support in seperate span tags not like
    we have done it here like all of them in the same span tag. -->
    </div><!--display: flex only works on the immediate child and if we change the width of the parent class then it can also change the width of
    child and if the width and height not mentioned in parent then the elements take up the size of largest child;-->

</div><!--If we had not used padding for zerodha logo also as we did for all other nav element then it would have expanded and we can also
use padding instead of br tag for spacing and font weight is used to change width of font and in button also we can use div only instead of a tag-->
